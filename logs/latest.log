[18:02:59] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> Trump is attracting the wrong kind of people
[18:03:07] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> he's gonna get us in a world war lol
[18:03:24] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> I'm british. but everything I see on this guy
[18:03:37] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> His temper is
[18:03:37] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> I watched a documentary made by anonymous on hilary clinton
[18:03:38] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> Somethin
[18:03:49] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> I wish I could've gone to Canada sooner
[18:04:04] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> The only reason I kindof favor Clinton more
[18:04:04] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> he's not planning on building a wall on the border is he?
[18:04:09] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> He is..
[18:04:14] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> Right on the Mexican border
[18:04:20] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> I meant canadia..
[18:04:24] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> I dont think so
[18:04:27] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> I thought he loved the mexicans mann
[18:04:31] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> lol
[18:04:38] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> full of shit. like all politicians
[18:04:46] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> I favor clinton more because she has political experience..
[18:04:57] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> And she's just going to enslave all males, not get us killed in WW3
[18:05:03] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> I'd do the same as I did in the brexit vote
[18:05:07] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> not fucking vote at all
[18:05:27] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> i cant vote yet so
[18:05:28] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> :P
[18:05:35] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> Bernie was America's only hope.
[18:05:53] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> So lets get off politics
[18:05:59] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> Lincoln and JFK were shot for been good presidents
[18:06:02] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> the shit ones live.
[18:06:08] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> Good point
[18:06:09] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> people have tried to kill trump and failed
[18:06:45] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> I find it funny how Black Lives Matter is considered a terrorist organization
[18:07:09] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> I hate groups like that.
[18:07:22] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> Yae
[18:07:29] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> White cop killed black man
[18:07:29] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> They don't really mean that. More like "more superior"
[18:07:36] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> thats why feminists and shit anoy me
[18:07:45] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> They don't get the backstory behind why the guy was shot
[18:07:48] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> Infact, a few weeks ago
[18:08:03] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> Some black guy pulled out a gun and started shooting at people & cops
[18:08:18] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> I guarentee if he hit & killed a cop, not one word would have been said about racism
[18:08:24] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> yep
[18:08:30] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> It's dumb how they're still pulling the race card
[18:08:36] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> there were riots in the uk a few years ago because of a black lad been killed
[18:08:49] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> if it had been a white guy like me.. people would have turned the page in the news
[18:08:49] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> Yea, that happens every few months here..
[18:09:03] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> Yea, one guy was in his car
[18:09:12] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> And he was supposedly reaching for his wallet
[18:09:15] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> The cops told him to stop
[18:09:23] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> They shot & killed him cuz he didnt stop
[18:09:33] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> don't get me started on cops with guns... haha
[18:09:35] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> Turns out he had a warrant for his arrest & was considered armed & dangerous
[18:09:45] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> but that was never mentioned
[18:09:48] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> Well
[18:09:56] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> Or was he...
[18:10:02] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> Bad cops ruin the name for good cops
[18:10:08] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> More good cops in this world than bad
[18:10:10] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> If it's mentioned in the media... people automatically believe it.
[18:10:55] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> they could have said he kept a pet penguin in the trunk and it would be believed
[18:10:59] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> :P
[18:11:06] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> Thats a bit far fetched but
[18:11:12] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> Some people probably would
[18:11:32] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <WalshyXD> I can't stand closed minded people ^_^
[18:11:44] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> I sat next to a guy on America's Most Wanted once..
[18:11:51] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> Public library
[18:11:55] [Async Chat Thread - #85/INFO]: <Pingas> Had no idea he was wanted lol
[18:13:10] [Async Chat Thread - #86/INFO]: <WalshyXD> what hit you first... the danger you win in or the cash reward you lost?
[18:13:58] [Async Chat Thread - #86/INFO]: <Pingas> The fact I was like an 11 year old kid sitting next to an adult male who was a murderer lol
[18:14:01] [Async Chat Thread - #86/INFO]: <Pingas> and i could've died
[18:14:02] [Async Chat Thread - #86/INFO]: <Pingas> idk

[19:15:28] [Async Chat Thread - #100/INFO]: <Pingas> I think you have it inverted.
[19:15:31] [Async Chat Thread - #100/INFO]: <Pingas> Yea
[19:15:31] [Server thread/INFO]: WalshyXD issued server command: /time day
[19:15:34] [Async Chat Thread - #100/INFO]: <Pingas> Wrong way

[19:16:11] [Server thread/INFO]: WalshyXD issued server command: /time night
[19:16:17] [Async Chat Thread - #100/INFO]: <WalshyXD> probably the spawn protection
[19:16:29] [Async Chat Thread - #100/INFO]: <Pingas> I dont think- actualy it may be
[19:16:33] [Async Chat Thread - #100/INFO]: <Pingas> But it pushed it at first
[19:16:48] [Server thread/INFO]: WalshyXD issued server command: /time day
[19:17:14] [Async Chat Thread - #100/INFO]: <Pingas> You could do the simple lights
[19:17:37] [Async Chat Thread - #100/INFO]: <WalshyXD> yeah... this is going to be cosmetic now :/
[19:18:11] [Async Chat Thread - #100/INFO]: <Pingas> Redstone lamp w/ inverted daylist sensor haha
[19:18:26] [Async Chat Thread - #100/INFO]: <WalshyXD> inverted sensor isn't a spawnable item :/

[19:19:07] [Async Chat Thread - #100/INFO]: <WalshyXD> how long has that been a thing
[19:19:25] [Async Chat Thread - #100/INFO]: <Pingas> I think since they added them
[19:19:39] [Async Chat Thread - #100/INFO]: <Pingas> Must be spawn protection
[19:19:42] [Async Chat Thread - #100/INFO]: <WalshyXD> yeh.
